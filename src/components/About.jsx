          Hello! I'm Loc Bui, a software engineer based in Seattle, WA, with a
          focus on creating high-quality, user-friendly, and efficient websites
          and web applications. I enjoy dedicating my time to developing new
          features, refining details, and optimizing both web and mobile
          applications. I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and
          Systems from the University of Washington Tacoma in 2017.

          When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing games, listening to music, or
          watching thrilling movies. I’m also passionate about sports like
          badminton, pickleball, and billiards.
